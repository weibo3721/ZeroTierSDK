 * which would complicate things. 1500 has been good enough on most LANs
 * for ages, so a larger MTU should be fine for the forseeable future. This
 * typically results in two UDP packets per single large frame. Experimental
 * results seem to show that this is good. Larger MTUs resulting in more
 * fragments seemed too brittle on slow/crummy links for no benefit.
 *
 * If this does change, also change it in tap.h in the tuntaposx code under
 * mac-tap.
 *
 * Overhead for a normal frame split into two packets:
 *
 * 1414 = 1444 (typical UDP MTU) - 28 (packet header) - 2 (ethertype)
 * 1428 = 1444 (typical UDP MTU) - 16 (fragment header)
 * SUM: 2842

 * and the second is to a function that can be used to get the location of
 * a physical address in X,Y,Z coordinate space (e.g. as cartesian coordinates
 * projected from the center of the Earth).
 *
 * Send function takes an arbitrary pointer followed by the cluster member ID
 * to send data to, a pointer to the data, and the length of the data. The
 * maximum message length is ZT_CLUSTER_MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH (65535). Messages
 * must be delivered whole and may be dropped or transposed, though high
 * failure rates are undesirable and can cause problems. Validity checking or
 * CRC is also not required since the Node validates the authenticity of
 * cluster messages using cryptogrphic methods and will silently drop invalid
 * messages.
 *
 * Address to location function is optional and if NULL geo-handoff is not
 * enabled (in this case x, y, and z in clusterInit are also unused). It
 * takes an arbitrary pointer followed by a physical address and three result
 * parameters for x, y, and z. It returns zero on failure or nonzero if these
 * three coordinates have been set. Coordinate space is arbitrary and can be
 * e.g. coordinates on Earth relative to Earth's center. These can be obtained
 * from latitutde and longitude with versions of the Haversine formula.
 *
 * See: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1185408/converting-from-longitude-latitude-to-cartesian-coordinates
 *

 * address to location function does not have a location for an address, it
 * should return zero and then look up the address for future use since it
 * will be called again in (typically) 1-3 minutes.
